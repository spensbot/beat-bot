# Beat Bot Dev Notes

## Todos

- Improved stats display
  - Hierarchy view. most important = biggest
  - Colored based on good -> bad | green -> red
- Stats depth slider (move the slider up to see progressively more detailed stats)
- Target Passing Score to consider a session accomplished?
- Per-Loop Stats
  - Target "passing" score to consider a BPM beaten?
    - E.G. Highest passing (>90%) BPM: 140
- Historical Stat Graphs (more based on absolute time (ms))
  - ms deviation
  - hightest passing hit period (you're able to pass sessions with 50ms between hits)
- Loops with multiple inputs
  - Left/right. Snare/kick, etc.
- per-hit session stats
  - Shorten loops to minimum repeat. Give hit-based averages for each hit in the loop over the whole session
- Loop instrument type

... later

- Integrate basic hit sound (snare probs)
